This is a discord bot created for Grand Valley's ESport's discord server.

## Getting Started

If you would like to run this server on your own PC, you will need to create a bot token of your own. Just google how to do that.

```
Create File Named Token.txt and add your bot token to the file.
Create File Named Database.txt and message me to get a temp password.
```

## Running

Once this application is up and running, you should see a window pop up. If it says ready, you have successfully connected!
